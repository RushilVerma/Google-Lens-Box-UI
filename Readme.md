# CornerBox Component

A dynamically resizable and draggable box with rounded corners, developed using Jetpack Compose. This component supports smooth resizing, boundary constraints, and center dragging, making it a versatile UI element for Android applications.

---

## Features

- **Resizable Corners**: Drag any corner to resize the box.
- **Center Dragging**: Move the entire box by dragging its center.
- **Boundary Constraints**: Ensures the box remains within its parent boundaries.
- **Corner Radius Validation**: Prevents the box size from shrinking below twice the corner radius.
- **Dynamic Boundaries**: Automatically adapts to the size of the parent container.
- **Smooth Animations**: Includes seamless transitions for resizing and dragging.

## Usage

### Adding the Component
```kotlin
@Composable
fun MyScreen() {
    MaterialTheme {
        CornerBox()
    }
}
```

### Customizing the Component
You can modify the initial position, size, and corner radius:
```kotlin
@Composable
fun MyCustomScreen() {
    MaterialTheme {
        CornerBox(
            modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize()
        )
    }
}
```

## Key Functions

### `isValidSize`
Ensures the box remains within boundaries and doesn't shrink below twice the corner radius:
```kotlin
private fun isValidSize(
    holeOffset: Offset,
    holeSize: Size,
    boundaryOffset: Offset,
    boundarySize: Size,
    cornerRadius: Float
): Boolean
```

### `isNearCorner`
Checks if a touch point is near a corner:
```kotlin
private fun isNearCorner(
    touchPoint: Offset,
    cornerOffset: Offset,
    radius: Float
): Boolean
```

### `isInsideBox`
Verifies if a touch point is inside the box:
```kotlin
private fun isInsideBox(point: Offset, boxOffset: Offset, boxSize: Size): Boolean
```

## Future Enhancements

- **Customizable Animations**: Allow developers to adjust animation duration and style.
- **Multi-Box Support**: Enable multiple resizable boxes within the same parent.
- **Advanced Styling**: Support additional visual effects like shadows and gradients.
